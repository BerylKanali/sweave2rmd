# For Bioconductor Package Maintainers

## Before Accepting a Pull Request

Please wait for Sweave2Rmd volunteers to review the pull request internally so
that they can address any issues that are not specific to your package. When
the pull request has passed an internal review, a volunteer will request that
you as the maintainer review the pull request to request any additional
changes if necessary to accept it.

## Squash and Merge a Pull Request

After a pull request has passed your review as a maintainer, you should merge
the request on GitHub, using the `squash and merge` option to reduce the commit
history.

## After Merging

We recommend that you

* run `BiocCheck` on the package and making any changes in a separate pull request
* update the NEWS file in a separate commit
* bump the version in the `DESCRIPTION` in a separate commit so that the build
  system will recognize that a new version is available to build

You should follow the usual workflow of package development described at
[Bioconductor Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/git-version-control.html)
to push to the Bioconductor repository.
