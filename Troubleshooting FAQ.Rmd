## Common Questions: 

### *Question:* Can I Add a Footnote in the YAML title or author fields? 

*Answer:* Ordinarily, footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret.
e.g., `^[This is a footnote.]`. However, due to a bug, footnotes in the YAML 
title or author fields no longer run. If attempted, you will receive a a LaTeX 
error. If you are converting a vignette and notice that the author byline 
includes a footnote, as does the Bioconductor vignette [Random Numbers in BiocParallel](https://docplayer.net/228745333-Random-numbers-in-biocparallel.html), 
there is a work around. In the YAML, add three drop down lines for the author. 
Include all or a combination of the following: name, affiliation, and email. See
below. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
author:
  name: Martin Morgan
  affiliation: Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY
  email: https://www.roswellpark.org/martin-morgan
```
